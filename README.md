The Rust Full Stack Mandelbrot App is an interactive web application designed to generate and display images of the Mandelbrot set, a famous fractal known for its intricate and fascinating patterns. This application showcases the power of Rust for backend development and React for frontend UI, offering both high performance and an engaging user experience.

Backend (Rust)
The backend of the application is built using Rust, a language known for its performance and safety. Key features include:

Actix-Web Framework: The backend server is built using the Actix-Web framework, providing a robust and efficient foundation for handling HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.

WebSocket Support: The server includes WebSocket functionality for real-time communication with the frontend. This is crucial for dynamically generating and streaming Mandelbrot set images based on user input.

Mandelbrot Set Generation: Rust's powerful computation capabilities are used to generate Mandelbrot set images. This involves complex number calculations, which Rust handles efficiently.

Image Processing: The server handles the conversion of computed Mandelbrot sets into image data, which can be transmitted to the frontend.

API Endpoints: RESTful API endpoints are provided for fetching Mandelbrot set images, allowing for HTTP requests with parameters defining the specific view or zoom level of the fractal.

CORS and Logging: The server is configured with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to ensure the frontend can freely interact with it, and logging for monitoring and debugging.

Frontend (React)
The frontend is developed using React, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface:

Interactive UI: Users can interact with the Mandelbrot set visualization, such as zooming in to explore different parts of the fractal or adjusting parameters to change its appearance.

WebSocket Integration: The frontend uses WebSocket connections to receive real-time Mandelbrot set data from the backend, allowing for a seamless and interactive experience.

Display and Control Components: The React app includes components for displaying the Mandelbrot set and UI controls for users to manipulate the view.

Responsive Design: The UI is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.

State Management: Efficient state management is implemented to handle the application's dynamic data and UI state, ensuring a smooth and fast user experience.

Overall Functionality
Users can explore the Mandelbrot set in real-time, with the ability to zoom in and out and move across different areas of the fractal. The app efficiently handles computation-intensive tasks on the backend while providing an interactive and user-friendly interface on the frontend. This full-stack Rust and React application demonstrates a powerful combination of performance and usability, ideal for computationally intensive tasks like fractal generation and visualization.
